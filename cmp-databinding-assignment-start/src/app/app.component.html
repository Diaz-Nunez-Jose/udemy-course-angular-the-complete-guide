        <li><p>The event should be listenable from outside the component</p></li>
        <li><p>When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))</p></li>
        <li><p>A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)</p></li>
        <li><p>Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components</p></li>
        <li><p>Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components</p></li>
